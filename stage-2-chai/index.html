                        <h2>Topic Overview</h2>
                        <p>
                            The topic domain I’m most interested in pursuing is music. I really would like to do something related to someone’s Spotify user history whether, it would be like the memories function on Snapchat or a web app for suggesting new music. 
                            I feel like there are a lot of options that you can get into with this domain and its something I find really interesting.
                            Additionally, there are a lot of possible music api's that can be used here whether that be Spotify or something else. It would be very effective to combine a few of these into a web app.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The creation of apps in this space could be really beneficial, 
                            because almost everyone listens to some sort of music and I’m sure people would be able to benefit from any additional music or any insights that can be gained from their music history. 
                            Right now there are some ways to get new music selections, but I would like to further customize this process by allowing the user of the app to input any information for the search. From genre, to artists, I would like to use the users Spotify history if possible as well.

                                This section will allow you to login via Spotify and enter certain search queries and preferences. 
                                This combined with previous Spotify listening history, will curate some new music suggestions for you in the form of a playlist.

                                From here you can click on any playlist you want and further break this playlist down by genre, author, and any other
                                tags that you may specify.
