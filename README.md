This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About this

This project is primarily a Spotify Data tracker which allows users to see what their top songs and artists on Spotify whenever they want. Normally this information is not easy to access through the Spotify App.

## Project Contributions

This project was mostly done through pair programming for the conversion into react components. Chai did the User Table, and Ash did the song chart. The other table was done together.
