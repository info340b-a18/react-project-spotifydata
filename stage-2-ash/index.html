      Spotify Web App Proposal

    <h2>
      Topic Overview
    </h2>
    <p id="block">
      The question of interest here is about the overall listening
      habits of users on spotify. People use spotify as their main
      music source every single day and listen to thousands of
      different songs, but currently there is not a clear way to
      see data about the music you listen to. I would like to
      create an application that synthesizes data about the
      listening habits of users, and then provides a summary
      detailing their music listening habits over time. The summary
      will include most listened to genres, songs, time of day of
      listening, most frequent artists, etc. Synthesizing all of
      this data will be possible because the API is extremely
      versatile and allows for a vast range of capabilities. I am
      looking forward to seeing how my own music listening is
      broken down.

    <h2>
      Potential Applications
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Analyzing Music habits, genres. time of listening, etc.
      </li>
      <li>Another potential application idea that could stem from
      this would be the creation of curated playlists based on
      listening habits. Though spotify already provides something
      similar it often does not actually appeal to the music tastes
      of the consumer, and could be much improved. This process is
      something that is difficult to carry out, but the algorithm
      could hopefully look at all genres listened to and create
      curated playlists that represent the broadness of music
      tastes people listen to.

      Below are buttons that support this page's interaction! Press login to authenticate your spotify account.
      From there, press Top to display your top 10 songs. From there you can see the artist and album of each one and 
      a link to play each song on the spotify web player. None of the buttons will work unless you authenticate your 
      account first! 
      Finally, click your top artists to see a graphic of your top 5 artists and how many genres 
      their music covers. Then navigate to the top artists page on the nav bar to see 
      your top 15 artists, indexed by their popularity on spotify!
